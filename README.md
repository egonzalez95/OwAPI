# Overwatch API
Blizzard has not released an actual API for Overwatch statistics, but rather, has allowed players to publicly view
profiles online and view their stats there. I plan to remedy this by creating a Java-based API that crawls the web-page and allows users
to pull specific data from PUBLIC/PRIVATE profiles. Keep in mind, that if Blizzard changes their profile page I will most
likely have to update this code. I will be using a Java based web-crawler using the JSoup library that I had previously
developed.

If this goes well, the few who care to make any Overwatch related application can use this! This is mostly for me though,
and exploring new crawling techniques.

## Running the API
To come. In developmental stages first, then functional API will be set.

## Documentation
Documentation for the API can be found [HERE](DOCUMENTATION.md)

## Intended Outcomes
    - An easy-to-use API
    - Username text-file parser to process multiple usernames
    - Exporter to save the results
    
## Notes
Let it be known that I am in no way affiliated with Blizzard. This scraper is not meant to cause damages and is purely
for allowing developers an option when coding Overwatch related projects.
